# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
# Delete all records from the database
CompanyProfile.delete_all
JobPosting.delete_all
JobType.delete_all

# Creates three job types
[ "Full Time", "Part Time", "Freelance" ].each do |job_type_name|
  JobType.create!(name: job_type_name)
end

# Creates three users
3.times do |n|
  User.create!(name: "User #{n}th", last_name: "Doe", email_address: "#{n}th@email.com", password: "password123", password_confirmation: "password123")
end

# Creates three company profiles
3.times do |n|
  profile = CompanyProfile.new(name: "Company Name #{n}", website_url: "http://company#{n}.com", contact_email: "contact@company#{n}.com")
  profile.logo.attach(io: File.open(Rails.root.join('spec/support/files/logo.jpg')), filename: 'logo.jpg')
  profile.user_id = n + 1
  profile.save!
end

# Creates three job postings
